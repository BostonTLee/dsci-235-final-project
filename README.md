# Analysis of World Happiness Report Data


## Analysis

This analysis is not a formal statistical analysis, but instead is meant to
demonstrate the capability of Pandas when applied to a real-world dataset. This
project aims to answer the following questions:

1. Are certain regions of the world happier than others?
1. Which factor contributes to happiness most, in different regions of the
world?
1. Which countries and regions have seen largest positive and negative changes
to happiness over the years included in the data (2015-2019)?

In answering the above questions, general hypotheses are formed to explain the
results seen. These hypotheses give very limited reasons for the changes, and
are meant as a starting-point for further questioning, not a true answer to the
complex subject at hand. 

## Data Source

The data for this project was pulled from the [Kaggle World Happiness
Report](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness) dataset. We do not claim
ownership over the data; it is included to allow execution of the code.
